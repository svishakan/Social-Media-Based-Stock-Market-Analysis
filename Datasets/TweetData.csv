Oil	@NYC1018 @KatiePhang Were prices going to go up regardless of biden or not? Yes of course. But I do not think we would have seen it surge as much as it did recently, if we didnt inject trillions into the economy last year. We are more reliant on other countries now for fuel and oil

Oil	@EvanMcMullin The issue is that the price at the pump is dictated by the price of the crude oil worldwide.
Oil	@GOPChairwoman Biden's not responsible for oil production and the oil companies like the prices where they are now. Their profits are up and they don't have to increase costs by producing more oil.

Oil	Domestic demand for palm oil alone saw an increase of 6% from 17.34 million tons in 2020 to 18.42 million tons in 2021. The third factor that contributed to the increase in CPO prices was the increase in the price of energy commodities, such as crude oil, gas, and coal.

EVs	@slphilxyz I think it really varies, generally, you need scale up to a point. Motors and transmissions for cars are very expensive to develop, and tend to get used over and over again in designs. The casting machine Tesla uses for the Model 3 rear end is very efficient, if you make enough.
EVs	@pmagn @VancouverSun Well certainly need nuclear power plants everywhere so everyones Tesla can be charged at once. Probably want to rebuild world power grids too.

EVs	@slphilxyz I think it really varies, generally, you need scale up to a point. Motors and transmissions for cars are very expensive to develop, and tend to get used over and over again in designs. The casting machine Tesla uses for the Model 3 rear end is very efficient, if you make enough.

But it's a con. The barely hidden side of the Agenda is depopulation. It's a fake left/right paradigm you are buying into.
EVs	@Silvercountry82 @BobWagner111 @u_ssucks @cjwhitma @greg_price11 You're actually just insane. Biden ran on the promise of fighting oil. Investing in EVs once he was elected was just reasonable. Also NWO? Jesus you're like a 2008 era conspiraboomer lmao
EVs	@jonathanrees6 @BrianRoemmele So you destroy the environment to harvest batteries....that then still need power. Gas comes out and IS the power. EVs are doubly destructive.
EVs	@janks729 @Paracelsus @AOC I paid for the extra electric motor. Electric motors are not an issue. Tesla vehicles in fact make us less dependent on China. Manchin is a liar whos been bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry not unlike every Republican in office. Citizens United v FEC is a problem!
EVs	@AllPeaks1 @AOC @localrach EVs, for the most part, never need trans work as they need no transmission. Wont need injectors either. Wont need most of those designed-to-fail pieces. Theyre infinitely more powerful, have more torque and require less maintenance.
EVs	@CreepyJTroll @ABC But according to Brandon and his chief supply chain expert mayor Pete - you can all just go buy and electric vehicle. They only run at around $45-50k to start. Probably cost an arm and a leg to insure. But yeah Dems are pro middle class alright.
EVs	@WholeMarsBlog Yeah solar cars like @aptera_motors help with that a lot because you might never visit a charging station again and surely will visit it less I hope tesla initiates a solar lineup already!
EVs	@PamKeithFL Maybe he is being paid by the electric vehicle companies. He is playing all of you. Smart dude
EVs	@DanielLFinn @McquinnFiona @Krempong803 @PPathole @elonmusk @Tesla @SpaceX @neuralink @boringcompany Actually the owner of the company actually approached Elon Musk for his help in expanding the company which he got renamed to Tesla motors. Elon is payed for his work and paid everyone else who contributed to the idea of what Tesla is now But please go on about how he stole ideas
EVs	@MattFarnsworth So many to list, but the top three are an alternative material home builder (to save the forests) a hi-fi loudspeaker builder (so you truly hear the music and films as recorded in studio) and to build an electric vehicle that charges itself while driving (patent pending)
EVs	"@WillThisDo42 @MrKRudd Dude. That's giving money to people who can afford EVs. The rich. And a few thousand EV's in Australia is not going to stop the rise in global emissions and ""reduce the cost of climate change"". Only a moron would suggest that. A complete waste of money."
EVs	@KHOU Now do the average price of a gas powered car and an electric vehicle.
EVs	@PamKeithFL You can have all the EVs you want. Just dont use economic pain at the pump to force others to buy one! Simple as that.
EVs	@JoeBiden curious why China motors.. I mean General China motors.. I mean GM gets tax credits for EV sales and not @tesla from @elonmusk ? GM is produced in China now and imported. Can we order tesla from China and get EV rebate credit ass well?
EVs	Reliance Industries Ltd. , Hyundai Global Motors Co. ,Rajesh Exports &amp; Ola Electric, have won bids to receive incentives under the countrys $2.4-billion (Rs 18,100 crore) scheme to build Tesla-style gigafactories that make battery cells Says Bloomberg Sources
EVs	@bread69 @PamKeithFL Really? According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for an electric vehicle in April 2021 was $51,532. That's more than $11,000 higher than what you'd pay at the dealership for a full-size gas-powered car, and nearly $30,000 more than the average compact car sale
EVs	@dagenmcdowell Has anyone figured out what it costs to charge a electric vehicle back up to full charge? Like done any studies on household electric bills before owning an electric vehicle and afterwards. Seems to me this is being ignored.
EVs	@WholeMarsBlog Indeed. This is another great advantage to EVs. How much losses happen in the cables on the way?
EVs	I have an electric vehicle. What the government is telling you is a lie. It takes over an hour to SUPERCHARGE my Tesla. Can you imagine waiting an hour to fill up? Or going 25 miles out of the way to charge? Read the rest of the problems they don't tell you about
EVs	@mike_rowe @decryption I wish there was a medium solution like electric conversion kits that arent just as expensive as a new electric vehicle
EVs	@SPornsite @LeAdderNoire Basically they don't want people using any fossil fuels or even flying. This all being done on purpose due to a climate agenda. The one thing people need to realise it that you need to drive over 70000 miles in an electric vehicle for them to be more 'environmently friendly'.

EVs	@Shut_the_fridge Recycling is not an issue currently. EVs are only 2% of all cars and have not been around long enough to generate enough old batteries. These batteries last about 10 yrs so in 10 yrs we will need companies such as Redwood Material who are gearing up battery recycling already.
EVs	@gamtnman62 @bakedbiscuit20 @teddygala @bestjoekim @SnazzyQ Or how the Mach-E has much better interior materials than Tesla...or Lucid Dream is significantly more luxurious than Plaid model S while offering more range all while having much more efficient/smaller motors.

Hydrogen is much safer then most vehicles on the roads today. Don't be disillusioned by propaganda. Hydrogen is the future. One day you will be driving one. I want you to remember ME every time you go to buy one or sit in one
EVs	@AOC China could kill the electric vehicle market overnight by refusing to sale batteries.
EVs	How many patents does Tesla Motors have? @Tesla has a total of 3304 patents globally. If someone uses a #Tesla patent and improves upon it, the improvements are then owned by Tesla. Users of #patents also may not use the design. Stop saying Tesla is open source or has no patents.
EVs	@Geeksrpeeps2 @aptera_motors Note that the Tesla plug currently has no V2G or V2H support. We should be able to use our EV to provide emergency power to our homes. It's not worth having a house battery sitting on standby waiting for emergencies.
EVs	@nationdivided @Missy9905 @elonmusk Yeah. He knows that most of the country doesn't have the infrastructure to support his company, plus a service vehicle can't sit around and wait to charge. It needs to be ready to go when it is needed. He knows these are just two of the HUGE problems with electric vehicles.
EVs	@alaskannah Since I was 5 yrs old, everybody agreed that if an invention caused Oil to lose money, they would buy it and shelve it. One example was a possible 100mpg car. Now 60 yr later it has come true, EVs. And now everyone has forgotten. Oil and Auto earn $5B a day. Wall street has......
EVs	@F_Casey_Lea @G_Paul_Musings @ChrisBEsq @crampell Whats more, Even though coal is the dirtiest way to produce electricity, an electric vehicle would produce less TOTAL emissions than a gasoline fueled vehicle even if the electricity is generated by coal.
EVs	@elonmusk I want to work for Tesla Motors
EVs	Inventor and entrepreneur Elon Musk is the founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, co-founder of Tesla Motors, and chairman of SolarCity. He is also the founder of The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.

EVs	China's electric vehicle maker NIO another Chinese dual-listed stock, fell -12.81% after its U.S. listed-shares plunged overnight on renewed delisting fears. U.S. SEC signals it will take action against U.S.-listed Chinese firms, that dont comply with U.S. audit requirements.
EVs	@Brian38701873 Absolutely! Especially based on current neomagnet technology, a part vital to #EV's, which require #RareEarths. Only @Tesla is using Induction Motors in its model 3s.

EVs	@elonmusk @Fla2407 -software to act like a life boat to save legacy from their self-induced demise (safety software in non teslas) -batteries and motors suitable for boats and planes -boring co JV with Tesla to power cities with sustainable transport -Tesla to own 20% of SpaceX via Tesla Ventures
EVs	@allDPNes Cutting the fuel excise - the current govt proposal - would be a big subsidy on not only private car use but fossil fuels. I think other states have it right in delaying a tax on EVs until they reach a certain % of market, otherwise it disincentivises ppl from switching.
EVs	@BJafari A really good start might be mandating minimum fuel efficiency and emission standards. Then get serious on promoting the uptake of EVs leave vagaries of the oil market to the past.
EVs	@DrOnDFS @CP24 Silly fool.. We don't have the power grid to support EVs never mind the stupid charging stations.
EVs	Elon Musk is the founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, co-founder of Tesla Motors, and chairman of SolarCity. He is also the founder of The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.

EVs	@m_1corona @JDanielH16 @elonmusk Ummmmmm...How many patents does Tesla Motors have? Tesla has a total of 3304 patents globally. These patents belong to 986 unique patent families. Out of 3304 patents, 2147 patents are active. Merry Xmas
EVs	@GlenStrong2 @JJ_McCullough Except he didn't. The Russian military is a paper tiger with a budget smaller than Tesla Motors, and the Russian economy is a one-trick pony smaller than that of California. The idea that Putin's Russia is a superpower is entirely an illusion.
EVs	@PamKeithFL You are so F.O.S. The average person working in the US today making minimum wage can barely afford to buy gas to go to work if they even have a job, can ill afford to buy a $50,000. electric vehicle! I don't know where you got your law degree from but I suggest economics instead!

EVs	@slphilxyz I think it really varies, generally, you need scale up to a point. Motors and transmissions for cars are very expensive to develop, and tend to get used over and over again in designs. The casting machine Tesla uses for the Model 3 rear end is very efficient, if you make enough.
EVs	@pmagn @VancouverSun Well certainly need nuclear power plants everywhere so everyones Tesla can be charged at once. Probably want to rebuild world power grids too. Look for some vast swathes of land for the mountains of batteries, plastics, and motors that will be discarded over the years, too.

EVs	@AdamBandt Norway has 75% of its cars as EVs. How can the Aus Government and opposition be so far behind in this critical component of reducing our CO2 emissions? We don't even need any original thought which would obviously be outside the scope of the Duopoly. There are established models.
EVs	@matteocomelli25 @TheRed789 @JonD05985532 @stevewoz Again, faster than a Model X and the motors can each individually put out 670hp (which it will in the single motor pure trim) but they dialed it back to only 555.5hp per motor for efficiency sake in the dual motor. Still more than any Tesla motor
EVs	@wenggonzales @elonmusk The average estimated annual salary, including base and bonus, at Tesla Motors is $110,192, or $52 per hour, while the estimated median salary is $114,033, or $54 per hour.
EVs	@ellensandell @joelgibson I get the desire to reduce the burden of going electric BUT distance charging is only a minor fraction of the cost of EV. Not taxing EVs *now* would make fairer vehicle taxation politically impossible (good luck adding a new tax when everyone has EVs)
EVs	@SawyerMerritt EVs dont need subsidies. No amount of government assistance will make the conversion go any faster. Production is at 100%. Use the money elsewhere.
EVs	@elonmusk jokes about Biden: 6) When Elon met Biden for the first time he had to tell him about Tesla. Why? Because Joe thought GM was the leader in electric cars still making the EV1. 7) Biden thinks ALL cars are electric cause they have starter motors. {To be Continued}
EVs	@Geriatric121 @NeilCam52208510 @LBC VED is a tax scaled on Co2 emissions so electric cars pay 0, as would cyclists if subject. As VED admin is ~3.75 per vehicle, collecting the 0 from cyclists would likely cost Gov ;150m per year! This is your great idea is it, waste taxpayers money

EVs	@CBCNB @WayneLongSJ Electric vehicle demand to surge?!?
EVs	The sooner we stop relying on oil the better. Problem with EVs is they cost heaps and there is no secondhand market. They need to be made affordable for the poor and we need to fully transition to renewable energy as soon as possible. It is expensive and irresponsible to wait.
EVs	@PamKeithFL I don't want an electric vehicle, you fascist scum.

EVs	@AndrewASink @UncleJessy4Real @Jeep only downside i can see is the manual transmission, adding complexity and points of failure where its not needed. I'm all in for electric wranglers. have y'all checked out the electric defenders with tesla motors and batteries?
EVs	@End_User @WholeMarsBlog You need to fight those lies at every turn. Every little act matters. We didnt get here at this moment where EVs are viewed as the future just by staying silent and letting people spread doubt about the benefit of not choking people with exhaust fumes

EVs	@WeaponOutfitter TBH, I want a basic ass car, maybe one with a cigarette lighter adapter, and a stereo input. I'm fine with EVs from a structure perspective, however this clashes with my doctrine perspectives. I do not want to live in the I Robot world where driving for yourself is unusual.
EVs	@WholeMarsBlog How about the power to refine the oil? Same as that needed to run an electric vehicle.
EVs	@End_User @WholeMarsBlog you are more detriment to EVs? thats funny, last time I checked he wasnt the one spreading 1990s-flavor oil propaganda
EVs	@PamKeithFL The more Manchin should help fund manufacturing of electric vehicle parts in West Virginia. It wont hurt his coal company investments, so why not.
EVs	I'm convimced now that @Tesla should do sth similar to @aptera_motors or @arcimoto if they want to stay true to their mission statement. This would make such a big Impact! Fewer parts, smaller battery pack + brand loyalty + FSD + ability to scale. It only makes sense!

EVs	@kairyssdal Heres what bugs me, why didnt you add who did? Here you go: Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place
EVs	@stewdean Because most components on a Tesla are electric [Steering, wheel motors] etc. Old cars are more mechanical. Thus not susceptible to hacks.
EVs	@OldManLefty1 Ummm, Joe, you won't ever be standing in any line with an electric vehicle. For any reason.
EVs	@ellensandell @BBugVic Then why start 'petrol prices are skyrocketing...scrap EV tax...'? You literally didn't mention these other issues in your hysterical tweet. True colours much?

EVs	@AbolishWages What the chart doesn't show is people charging their EVs using local off-grid solar energy. Try filling up a fuel tank with photons &amp; let us know how you get on.
EVs	I think evs will take a bigger hit soon. all depends on tesla (weak). I see NIO under $10 in the next two weeks and confident ford takes a hit to low 15s or 14s soon.
EVs	This is because the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution
EVs	@Kinaho Well This can be compared to Tesla Roadster First Models. Which used Porsche Lotus Frame and body panels bought from Porsche and fitted with Electric Motors and Controls to make it electric car. But Yatri is doing more better as they manufacturer their own 1/2

EVs	@diane_berwick They already do, vehicle tax is partially calculated on the factory declared emissions of a vehicle. Diesel far more expensive than petrol for equal engine size. When electric cars saturate the roads, they'll remove all benefits of electric by charging a per mile road user free.
EVs	@LisaTrumpstr Some lithium chemistries don't use cobalt. Standard phone and laptop style cells are lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide, and these are common in EVs, but many also use lithium iron phosphate, which are cheaper, lower energy density and longer cycle life.
EVs	@GordonJohnson19 Make electric vehicle charging more accessible to low income populations - one of the dumber sentences Ive read in weeks.
EVs	@DeadArchist Use Turo. Generally cheaper, you can choose the model you want, and that app might as well become a Tesla ride share app with how many are always available Any trim of the S is good, but if you go X, Y, or 3, try and get one with dual motors (and ludicrous mode)
EVs	@PamKeithFL If you give up air travel, Ill drive an electric vehicle. Didnt think so
EVs	@DjoshUnchained @nytimes Honestly mail trucks is a great use of EVs as they have high utilisation and predictable routes. Probably more to do with lack of supply.

EVs	@AbolishWages People are not all going to shift to bicycles so EVs are the best option we have right now. Even breathing produces CO, doesn't mean we should stop doing it.
EVs	@janusPrime Depends on which market share. So no, it doesn't have to mean more EVs than ice. It corks mean they have 1% market share in the ice market, and 2% in the (much smaller) ev market.
EVs	@FreeStateNH VERY expensive. Libertarians wouldn't subsidize the gas. Since $5.4T in various types of assistance are given to oil per year, and 80% of that assistance goes to fuel, you're looking at an increase of $9/gal or so over current prices. In a libertarian society, we drive EVs.
EVs	@SmileyGnome Funny story, I asked! They (Tesla salesman) wouldnt answer and said thats why theyre tow trucks. To which I replied had gas motors and walk away
EVs	Inflate/deflate: USPS claims the vehicles 94-kilowatt hour battery can only travel around 70 miles. Thats the most inefficient electric vehicle Ive ever seenshould have a range two to three times greater battery should be half the size
EVs	@MarceloPLima Edison was a con man and a grifter, pushed everyone around with hired thugs, all his patent inventory came from the minds of his interns like Tesla. Edison struggled to grasp the alternating current theory that runs our world today, like induction motors.

Gaming	Recently got back to xbox and did the remote play and I loved it, honestly I think xbox killed it with there gamepass 15 a monthly, killed the competition
Gaming	@ghostshadow25 Devs are more lazy now then they were on 5th gen consoles (N64 PS1) and 6th gen (PS2 GameCube OG Xbox) some of those games had mirror reflections and it was harder to do as well. Now its easier them ever yet not used cause detail in games is being ignored in favor of other stuff
Gaming	@1andDon3 @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation What an idiot. The reality is that this cheap tactics and timed exclusive games is what Sony can afford
Gaming	@MLGchimpfeet Yeah exactly. In game challenges were just easier and were more accessible for causal players. Yeah Achievements died with Xbox One in my opinion due to the interface and profile display. Was still fun getting them though
Gaming	@ForHonorGame So with the addition of cross play. When phase two hits. Will I have the ability to merge my xbox and playstation accounts? I have progress on both and I'd like to be able have both reps on both platforms.
Gaming	@crusader_r6s @Rainbow6Game Xbox auto update is a fucking joke.

Gaming	@JayZee_XO @jdogggful @blakeway_luke @EBGamesAus Can you play PS1, PS2 and PS3 games on the PS5? No you cant! But on the Xbox Series X you can play original Xbox games, Xbox 360 games and Xbox One games. Microsoft has nailed the backwards compatibility.
Gaming	For Xbox, if that helps
Gaming	@KelTekYoungGun @AlfaTango1997 @getfandomgaming Its on the official website... its for pc and xbox as well

Gaming	@kidsmoove I think Xbox games will be very much optimised and make the 3rd party games look sus, which may force them to utilise every feature. And 3rd party developers already know that the players will only buy their games if they are very good else they know people have game pass.
Gaming	@fforigin @FinalFantasy @PlayStation @Xbox @fforigin PS4 players cannot transfer demo saves because the wrong version was uploaded for the early access. Demo is Version 1.01; Full game is 1.00... will there be a fix for this soon?

Gaming	@marlisjun Sony should hire you, and put in a good word for me, by the way. I love Playstation every bit as much.
Gaming	@EditoMZ @oldmategamer @haveyouseen01 Xbox in 2013 just basically did what PS did back in 2006
Gaming	@marlisjun I don't think Xbix has beaten PlayStation in the U.S. since 360. I think that's why people are making a big deal over it. Even though series S is more readily avaialable than PS5, it's still impressive.
Gaming	@mistres__helena @Aarow_16 @jz43871 @wbgames @PlayStation @HogwartsLegacy It will be available on playstation, xbox and pc, you can actually look for the game in the microsoft/xbox store and it will show you the info
Gaming	@UniAlexGame @TASNoContext Mega Man &amp; Bass (Rockman &amp; Forte) was released in '98 for Super Famicom and used graphics from Mega Man 8 on Playstation/Saturn because they wanted to throw gamers still on last gen a bone. Castlevania Dracula X was a near-identical situation 3 years prior.
Gaming	@XxXBaylieeXxX U play xbox one or ps

Gaming	@mistres__helena @jz43871 @wbgames @PlayStation @HogwartsLegacy Okay mommy
Gaming	Effective immediately MNN is dropping it's support of Global Strategy Corporation Enterprise and their entities, reason being is that this isn't the first time needless drama has erupted between GSCE and someone else from the playstation or xbox side of the house..
Gaming	@Xbox do you hate blacks
Gaming	@XboxAmbassadors My big brother's old N64. He was 13 then and bought a Ps2 and an xbox with the money he saved up from grandma's gifts and gave me his old n64. Ocarina of Time blew out my fucking mind when I first played it. And since then, I've been an avid gamer.
Gaming	@MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation so you guys are worried?
Gaming	Like seriously, I'm shocked Playstation approved the script, it's like they didn't care.
Gaming	@moitoi Hello can you unban me on PlayStation please. I spent 6 years on this game with good behavior then said one stupid comment and got banned permanently. Please I love this game and wont make the same mistake. I have spent $600 on this game and promise I learned my lesson. Please
Gaming	@WOOLLEY_GAMER You must not watch Iron Lord's. It's not a fanboy podcast at all. Don't get misled by King doing his thing and having fun about Sony. They regularly speak very highly of Playstation and don't trash and spew hate the way you think they do.
Gaming	@Gluttonyfangs4 @ZackAaron01 @TaquinJ @fforigin @GameStop @GameStopCanada @PlayStation @Xbox It means PS4 has version 1.00 and the demo is 1.01 which is the version that PS5 has. This means you cannot use your saved data of the demo and play with people in PS5. Aka this is a cluster fuck.
Gaming	@wydccalamity Cuz everyone knos PlayStation better
Gaming	@clown_pdf Weird. All the people i know that have Iphones shit on people that play playstation instead of xbox
Gaming	@djgotdasauce @PuckingFuzzled @LovesPatches @TheNerdyHD @deshawn26840284 @MicroMakesMusic @wydccalamity Xbox has the gamepass and it's bad I made a thread complaining about how genuinely shit it is I'm not even here for the Xbox v Playstation debate I just genuinely hate the gamepass with a passion
Gaming	@SuperPositiveGs @RandolphBronson @SpookiLord @marlisjun @PlayStation Something he made up in his mind, like what console you play on means you are a specific style of gamer. Lmao
Gaming	"Cannot believe Xbox live had me telling people to ""kys"" when I was 12 what the fuck LMAO"
Gaming	@OGG1993 Im really starting to think that the hardcore PlayStation fan base kicked the diehard Xbox fan base a little too hard in the head last generation, because they havent been the same since.
Gaming	@Gl_acial @its_menieb @PlayStation And you failed with that tweet alone gtfo
Gaming	@BattlefieldComm @Battlefield @EAHelp Please @EA_DICE @Battlefield @BattlefieldComm please fix the issue with cross play. Sucks I can't even turn off the option just play with Xbox players cause the extremely long loading to find/no players hate playing With pc players.. Please fix this issue please
Gaming	@cronieees @IGN U hate on Xbox all the time ?
Gaming	@fforigin @GameStop @GameStopCanada @PlayStation @Xbox That's all cool and stuff but I want to be able to transfer my demo data to the full game on ps4 already so I can continue the story. Already have 30+ hours grinding the first 5 missions.
Gaming	@RockstarSupport am I messing raytracing or something on Xbox series s it says it in bio on store but not in settings just says performance but doesnt say performance rt

Gaming	I will be (re)buying Paradise Killer when it drops on PlayStation this week. Cannot wait to revisit this phenomenal game world.
Gaming	@Danielsand @PlayStation Yeah, no its fine if they just don't mention anything about her.
Gaming	@ZackAaron01 @TaquinJ @fforigin @GameStop @GameStopCanada @PlayStation @Xbox What do you mean bring the game up 1?
Gaming	@improxgames @Xbox Thrilled to have you!
Gaming	@EvanNixonType4 iirc its also one of the very few Xbox games that doesn't support either widescreen or progressive scan.
Gaming	Get new rewards, launch a daring rescue and uncover secrets. Ascending Tide contains two new dungeons to explore to start your Legacy of the Bretons adventure. The new DLC arrives Mar 14 on PC, Mar 29 on Xbox &amp; PlayStation consoles.
Gaming	@PlayStation I find it unbelievable how Sony does this nonsense to make it look like it's a plesteytion thing.
Gaming	@R0guez1 @ForzaHorizon @WeArePlayground @Xbox This right here...mind-blowingly good! Would love to see a behind-the-scenes shot. But also totally understand if you didn't. ;) This would surely win any PhoRev round with ease!
Gaming	@amritabithi oh that reminds me, a while back i got interested in the xbox drum hero kits, cos they have midi ports on them) i seem to recall the issue was they didnt send a note off, which caused issues (too many hanging notes)
Gaming	@SHEEPRAMPAGE Personally, Help Wanted. I had a whole different idea of what security breach was. I thought it would be classic nights but free roam which from what I remember people have wanted forever lol prolly cuz I didn't watch alot of trailers only a single playstation one.
Gaming	If you're wondering about nintendo switch and xbox series x and ps5, buy ps5.
Gaming	@PabloMakes Hello can you unban me on PlayStation please. I spent 6 years on this game with good behavior then said one stupid comment and got banned permanently. Please I love this game and wont make the same mistake. I have spent $600 on this game and promise I learned my lesson.

Gaming	@Lune_ I got my Xbox taken away
Gaming	@dleonxl @Is_a_dumb_name @1andDon3 @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation Tbf, advertising another companies work can lead to negative press for your company. Say you owned Sony and advertised Cyberpunk 2077 heavily, doing most of the marketing,etc. Well if the game is bad, Sony is going to be questioned on why they advertised the game.
Gaming	@KalebCenite @WWEgames Say PS4 instead PlayStation because this is NOT an issue on PS5. Well, at least not for me.
Gaming	Im sorry @PlayStation I just want my account back
Gaming	@mortivoree @Xbox That's why it's my banner...
Gaming	@Xbox put WWE2k22 on game pass
Gaming	@RockstarSupport the least you guys can do it fix the crash bug in ps4 and Xbox with the heavy sniper
Gaming	@poncho_playa @kidsmoove I would acknowledge that it would be big, just not Xbox nail in the coffin big. If Sony did buy them and then sought to make all their stuff exclusive, then Microsoft can drop a massive COD exclusive bomb on Sony's head once existing agreements are done.
Gaming	@PlayStation Hogwarts fans, get excited!
Gaming	@stin0s @AgiIeOnes Ever need 1 for a 6man lmk, (playstation, PC)
Gaming	@Acesandy1 @gorillaarmy88 @Yan2295 Yup. I saw a guy with 680 gamerscore on xbox and rank 1500, he obviously did the RP glitch. And well. He was fine.

Gaming	@XaeSZN Xbox sadly
Gaming	@Tracker_RY Xbox Series X is still available on Walmart as of right now!
Gaming	@jtwilson37 @GameGeniPrime Not cheaply made per say but they've always been too small for my hands. The xbox controllers are the perfect size for me.
Gaming	Why would you disrespect your son by letting a nigga youre fucking, play on his PlayStation and eat his fruit snacks?
Gaming	@fforigin @GameStop @GameStopCanada @PlayStation @Xbox hello could you fix the bugs on the resolution and performance soon because at times it makes everything very blurry and unplayable it hurts the eyes
Gaming	@ForHonorGame So with the addition of cross play. When phase two hits. Will I have the ability to merge my xbox and playstation accounts? I have progress on both and I'd like to be able have both reps on both platforms.
Gaming	@jbonapa1 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Lol not everyone is a blind fanboy like you bud. I love my PlayStation. I can admit when a game doesnt look the best. I can call out clowns like you that cant even type a sentence correctly. Its not hard.

Gaming	@mistres__helena @Aarow_16 @jz43871 @wbgames @PlayStation @HogwartsLegacy Sony just happens to have the marketing rights for this one, but it doesn't mean that is an PS exclusive
Gaming	@KelTekYoungGun @AlfaTango1997 @getfandomgaming Its on the official website... its for pc and xbox as well
Gaming	Anyone on PlayStation?
Gaming	@Colteastwood I got the ps5 since I have a pc, I enjoy having both but Xbox is got the best studios these days hands down.
Gaming	@marlisjun Well since all this debacle about the systems I'm thinking definitely grabbing a PS5 ( if it's available to buy that is) and play these games . Saw the state of play looks amazing.. I've been an Xbox player mostly but Horizon etc really want to play it. Getting my son one too
Gaming	@Lombrad00673265 @zmac9906 @Rainbow6Game Xbox siege is a joke. My friends get sound glitches then kicked, then they rejoin only to get it again not one round later.
Gaming	Enjoying #SpringBreak playing #HorizonForbiddenWest! We Stan a strong female protagonist. @PlayStation
Gaming	@Leothefoxr7 You play in PlayStation
Gaming	@Sylencioo @Stormlinski76 Only thing is you can't play on Xbox one anymore after the transfer but it's worth it
Gaming	@morsmutual_ My rig handled gta 5 &amp; online okay but like 20-40or30 fps with graphics on medium &amp; 1920x1080 as resolution and it felt like i was playing on xbox 360 or ps3 lol
Gaming	@MrBlizzardX @ForceinUnison @sjfostersound @PlayStation Motion sickness is not really a tech problem but sony did include a vibration motor which can help to reduce motion sickness.

Gaming	@WalmartCAGaming @PlayStation Ohhhhh yeah
Gaming	@nicethingsagain @WWEgames Well someone said that 2k said playstation and 2k wasn't being specific with that statement
Gaming	@C_Rumbel @firas_killer @majornelson Its only $10 us instead of the $20 Xbox. So slight discount and end up saving $30 total.
Gaming	@kidsmoove Bro this is the fucking reason why xbox is buying up many studios so that they can implement these features in their games. I think Microsoft is pissed on third party developers for not optimising and utilising rdna 2 feature in games.
Gaming	@AJEnglish the volunteer if they escape death in ukraine they will be mentally sick and with psychiatric problems once the war finish. the war isnt like in playstation
Gaming	@ChalsAbuah @dleonxl @MSTretrogaming @VGC_News Brother, this includes deathloop and psychnauts, both PlayStation and Xbox multiplats, that Xbox game studios had no part in. You get the high scoring game in forza horizon for 1 year and then go back to getting crushed by PlayStation until the next forza horizon. Repeat gen lol
Gaming	@roborat14 @VGC_News Full pallets of PlayStations at Costco err XBox my bad.
Gaming	@JustAnLED @PlayStation Hottest take ever.
Gaming	@ItsCsteph @mortivoree @Xbox Government loves Microsoft... That's why Apple was bytchin.
Gaming	@MK8MasterJunjie @PokeMasterMegan @robski187 @EBGamesAus Do you believe youre Jesus? You were just being rude to someone into buying them an Xbox when the person prefers PlayStation. You really are incapable of admitting your flaws.
Gaming	@xdAWESOMES @RockstarGames Hells yeah I didn't think it would for me because I was playing on Xbox One and transferred to a PS5
Gaming	@PlayStation It's gonna be available on all platform
Gaming	@SkullziTV Oh man! This generation's console wars version is ridiculous. I see many PS (me PS only) accounts bashing Starfield for no reason. Xbox doesn't interest me but I assure you I will get one for Starfield. BGS is my N.1 games. I haven't waited all this time for nothing
Gaming	@RockstarSupport Need help migrating my character from my Xbox One to my Series S. It doesn't show me the new screen and I'm confused on it. It didn't show the new intro either...anything I can do? :/

Gaming	@dleonxl @Is_a_dumb_name @1andDon3 @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation Of course they can always defend themselves rather easily, or just ignore it. But it will cause them bad press. Even worse if it's a first party game.
Gaming	Uncharted review: Sad PlayStation approved a continuity error plot lacking enough puzzles and forgot Nate's Personality and jokes. The journey felt too easy, rushed, and the casting for Sully and Nate was poorly done. I love Mark and Tom, but no. Lackluster writing.

Gaming	"Typing up my Post Fight Interview Q&amp;A with Michael Bisping &amp; I'm emoji incarnate, listening to him grouse about modern video games: ""Oh, you need a health pack, and youve gotta to skin this animal to make this, and I'm like, this is a lot. Come on!"" Much funnier to hear him."
Gaming	@Bigwale02 @vivian_porsche @PlayStation @davido I day tell you to work on your self not stop the hate one obo hes a bigger person allready pray you also excel in life don hate others
Gaming	@InkfaceFahz But on the whole he was exceptionally well-acted, and coming from the frankly atrocious acting in Deus Ex 1 and Invisible War, that just really, really stood out. Hell, video games in general /still/ have a very low bar for acting quality, and HR and MD both remain exceptional
Gaming	@marlisjun Sony should hire you, and put in a good word for me, by the way. I love Playstation every bit as much.
Gaming	@EditoMZ @oldmategamer @haveyouseen01 Xbox in 2013 just basically did what PS did back in 2006
Gaming	@artyshruti Your son is 14 i m certain he watches Hollywood movies n plays video games so blood, gore and violence is not alien to him. Take him to see #TheKashmirFiles the current generation needs to know.
Gaming	@marlisjun I don't think Xbix has beaten PlayStation in the U.S. since 360. I think that's why people are making a big deal over it. Even though series S is more readily avaialable than PS5, it's still impressive.
Gaming	@Coinhub_Wallet @ElementX_BSC I enjoy playing video games. It's enjoyable to be able to participate in a variety of games while earning rewards. How do I access the #ElementX game? Is it necessary to download an app or is it available on the website? Is there a set number of tokens that must be purchased in
Gaming	most video games have 4 easy modes and 1 frustrating-as-fuck-die-by-cheap-shots mode
Gaming	@mistres__helena @Aarow_16 @jz43871 @wbgames @PlayStation @HogwartsLegacy It will be available on playstation, xbox and pc, you can actually look for the game in the microsoft/xbox store and it will show you the info
Gaming	@UniAlexGame @TASNoContext Mega Man &amp; Bass (Rockman &amp; Forte) was released in '98 for Super Famicom and used graphics from Mega Man 8 on Playstation/Saturn because they wanted to throw gamers still on last gen a bone. Castlevania Dracula X was a near-identical situation 3 years prior.
Gaming	@XxXBaylieeXxX U play xbox one or ps
Gaming	@Stormlinski76 Restart the game trust me did the same thing to me and I was transferring from Xbox One to PS5

Gaming	Recently got back to xbox and did the remote play and I loved it, honestly I think xbox killed it with there gamepass 15 a monthly, killed the competition
Gaming	@JoePapaWendigo @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation Uh no, they dont think do, its just you guys that are stupid enough to think that.
Gaming	@MagsPowerBass @AidZen91 @PaulCPace @PlayStation Not even pretty much dude, it's a small portion which they won't notice.
Gaming	I have been playing so much Elden Ring this week that I'm getting wrist pain again. I might buy a wrist brace so I can play video games.
Gaming	@mistres__helena @jz43871 @wbgames @PlayStation @HogwartsLegacy Okay mommy
Gaming	Effective immediately MNN is dropping it's support of Global Strategy Corporation Enterprise and their entities, reason being is that this isn't the first time needless drama has erupted between GSCE and someone else from the playstation or xbox side of the house..
Gaming	@Houya_hafu We just keep watching movies and play games together in video calls every night and just doing these simple things is already enough for us cause all we wanted from each other is time to be together and spending time together is all we need
Gaming	@Xbox do you hate blacks
Gaming	@XboxAmbassadors My big brother's old N64. He was 13 then and bought a Ps2 and an xbox with the money he saved up from grandma's gifts and gave me his old n64. Ocarina of Time blew out my fucking mind when I first played it. And since then, I've been an avid gamer.
Gaming	@MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation so you guys are worried?
Gaming	@SkullAndyPad @RetroComplex1 Carl watch the video, its a discussion point. And if I couldnt afford gas I would not sell my video games. I would sell blood first

Gaming	"@uncannyr @MOOFIEcowstine @Overbro_ 1. It really doesn't, anime is so different from real life that actual pedophiles aren't gona be into that because they already go for actual kids, like, what you're saying is literally a parallel to the boomer argument that ""playing video games = school shooters"" 2. Nah, if you"
Gaming	@tweeterisawful would Klingon parents be against video games that werent violent enough? Just asking questions I just think itd be kicking rad if Klingons played Doom and really dug it
Gaming	Like seriously, I'm shocked Playstation approved the script, it's like they didn't care.
Gaming	@moitoi Hello can you unban me on PlayStation please. I spent 6 years on this game with good behavior then said one stupid comment and got banned permanently. Please I love this game and wont make the same mistake. I have spent $600 on this game and promise I learned my lesson. Please
Gaming	@uncannyr @MOOFIEcowstine @Overbro_ The problem is you STILL comparing drawings to sctual children, like bro, you think video games are equal to murder and genocide too? You whining over fiction is weird lol, the amount of reach and actual mental gymnastics to keep whining over people liking fiction is ludicrous.

Gaming	It's a little harder to cheat at video games, isn't it...
Gaming	@WOOLLEY_GAMER You must not watch Iron Lord's. It's not a fanboy podcast at all. Don't get misled by King doing his thing and having fun about Sony. They regularly speak very highly of Playstation and don't trash and spew hate the way you think they do.
Gaming	Finger me while I play video games please ;3 #nsfwtwt #nsfwtwt
Gaming	@JonReflex Prove it to me that you make money of video games and you're top .7%. I wasn't born yesterday lol.
Gaming	@Gluttonyfangs4 @ZackAaron01 @TaquinJ @fforigin @GameStop @GameStopCanada @PlayStation @Xbox It means PS4 has version 1.00 and the demo is 1.01 which is the version that PS5 has. This means you cannot use your saved data of the demo and play with people in PS5. Aka this is a cluster fuck.
Gaming	@wydccalamity Cuz everyone knos PlayStation better
Gaming	@clown_pdf Weird. All the people i know that have Iphones shit on people that play playstation instead of xbox
Gaming	@djgotdasauce @PuckingFuzzled @LovesPatches @TheNerdyHD @deshawn26840284 @MicroMakesMusic @wydccalamity Xbox has the gamepass and it's bad I made a thread complaining about how genuinely shit it is I'm not even here for the Xbox v Playstation debate I just genuinely hate the gamepass with a passion
Gaming	@PatriotJay1994 @AnnCoulter A fella!! Get back in your basement and finish your video games
Gaming	What are good pc video games. I have Minecraft and the sims but I want more
Gaming	@SuperPositiveGs @RandolphBronson @SpookiLord @marlisjun @PlayStation Something he made up in his mind, like what console you play on means you are a specific style of gamer. Lmao

Gaming	@OGG1993 Im really starting to think that the hardcore PlayStation fan base kicked the diehard Xbox fan base a little too hard in the head last generation, because they havent been the same since.
Gaming	@DailyCaller Just like the video games, Ann!
Gaming	@Gl_acial @its_menieb @PlayStation And you failed with that tweet alone gtfo
Gaming	@BattlefieldComm @Battlefield @EAHelp Please @EA_DICE @Battlefield @BattlefieldComm please fix the issue with cross play.

Gaming	@cronieees @IGN U hate on Xbox all the time ?
Gaming	@fforigin @GameStop @GameStopCanada @PlayStation @Xbox That's all cool and stuff but I want to be able to transfer my demo data to the full game on ps4 already so I can continue the story. Already have 30+ hours grinding the first 5 missions.
Gaming	@RockstarSupport am I messing raytracing or something on Xbox series s it says it in bio on store but not in settings just says performance but doesnt say performance rt

Gaming	@Nightfallgamez On my last stream, I wound up spending half of it just talking about video games and showing off some of the more niche RPGs I have. It's so much fun just chatting with people about games Gonna be doing my first full Just Chatting stream next weekend and see how it goes!

Gaming	I will be (re)buying Paradise Killer when it drops on PlayStation this week. Cannot wait to revisit this phenomenal game world.

Gaming	@Danielsand @PlayStation Yeah, no its fine if they just don't mention anything about her.
Gaming	@ZackAaron01 @TaquinJ @fforigin @GameStop @GameStopCanada @PlayStation @Xbox What do you mean bring the game up 1?
Gaming	@improxgames @Xbox Thrilled to have you!
Gaming	@EvanNixonType4 iirc its also one of the very few Xbox games that doesn't support either widescreen or progressive scan.
Gaming	Get new rewards, launch a daring rescue and uncover secrets. Ascending Tide contains two new dungeons to explore to start your Legacy of the Bretons adventure. The new DLC arrives Mar 14 on PC, Mar 29 on Xbox &amp; PlayStation consoles.
Gaming	I would be rather be having sex than okay video games but oh well
Gaming	Video games are so ass
Gaming	@PlayStation I find it unbelievable how Sony does this nonsense to make it look like it's a plesteytion thing.
Gaming	people who can play video games for hours at a time: how do you do it
Gaming	@R0guez1 @ForzaHorizon @WeArePlayground @Xbox This right here...mind-blowingly good! Would love to see a behind-the-scenes shot. But also totally understand if you didn't. ;) This would surely win any PhoRev round with ease!
Gaming	@amritabithi oh that reminds me, a while back i got interested in the xbox drum hero kits, cos they have midi ports on them) i seem to recall the issue was they didnt send a note off, which caused issues (too many hanging notes)
Gaming	Started playing Elden Ring. I am very bad at video games, and this is going to be a very good time. My instinct in video games, as it was when I was a child, is to run to the coolest thing I can see with little regard for consequences. If possible, I will climb said thing.
Gaming	@SHEEPRAMPAGE Personally, Help Wanted. I had a whole different idea of what security breach was. I thought it would be classic nights but free roam which from what I remember people have wanted forever lol prolly cuz I didn't watch alot of trailers only a single playstation one.
Gaming	.@yeul_e started making music because of the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X soundtracks. Who said video games get you nowhere.
Gaming	@HarleyShah yep, i only like to watch movies and tv shows i already know word for word, i play the same video games over and over on loop too, it's reassuring knowing what's coming, i assumed it was just a trauma response to a terrifying world, seeking the comfort of familiarity
Gaming	@Badxisabella video games
Gaming	If you're wondering about nintendo switch and xbox series x and ps5, buy ps5.
Gaming	oh my god what was i doing? oh right, leisure, relaxation, video games,
Gaming	@PabloMakes Hello can you unban me on PlayStation please. I spent 6 years on this game with good behavior then said one stupid comment and got banned permanently. Please I love this game and wont make the same mistake. I have spent $600 on this game and promise I learned my lesson.
Gaming	got banned on xbox live for saying at least my goat isnt a sex offender
Gaming	I can finally afford so many video games and appreciate genres I was never interested in before and I have time for almost none of them
Gaming	Old heads will never wrap their heads around people watching other people play video games
Gaming	@LiberalWis @JurassicTay @PlayStation But the backlash was gonna be always there. No matter when this gets revealed.
Gaming	@wydccalamity @sadcrib Xbox good, Playstation not
Gaming	@crusader_r6s @Rainbow6Game Xbox auto update is a fucking joke.
Gaming	@SpiritArzo @OriTheGame Good times limbo in xbox live aaaaa
Gaming	@ChaiThePie I love you too Keana so fucking much youve been here with me for 13 years like holy fuck weve just naturally been playing video games for that long together we just get on and play no setup no play date
Gaming	11. This is sorta twofold Video games have always been an escape for me, plus I've always been surrounded by music. It's part of how I connect to things, people, places, etc. So those two things together make for a very meaningful experience
Gaming	@8Osjk Seokjin definitely, is my bias because he resembles my type of man, that sense of humor, playing video games, cooking and fishing, activities exciting enough for me
Gaming	@Lune_ I got my Xbox taken away
Gaming	@dleonxl @Is_a_dumb_name @1andDon3 @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation Tbf, advertising another companies work can lead to negative press for your company. Say you owned Sony and advertised Cyberpunk 2077 heavily, doing most of the marketing,etc. Well if the game is bad, Sony is going to be questioned on why they advertised the game.
Gaming	@RebelTheArtGal @MOOFIEcowstine @Overbro_ no lol are you retarded i said jerking off to a drawing of a child is weird given that fiction or not you only jerk off to shit that you find hot, idk why you think the same logic somehow applies to killing people in video games
Gaming	@GoScv120 In my opinion, I totally agree. Actually, companies have more costs to improve the quality of their products, as a result of which video games are no exception.
Gaming	@chrisjsankey One thing I learned from video games: You know youre going the right way when you find enemies (I Cant remember the source tweet, but this is not my material)
Gaming	@Volataride @ZubyMusic Because this person is allowed to tell others what is fun and what is not? I don't find video games fun anymore, but does that mean they're not? No. They're just not mu cup of tea.
Gaming	@KalebCenite @WWEgames Say PS4 instead PlayStation because this is NOT an issue on PS5. Well, at least not for me.
Gaming	Does anyone know of any articles exploring any relationship between newer video games that center/build off of storytelling based off of Norse mythology and increased or changing formations of global white ethno-nationalism (also read as continued Lost Cause)?
Gaming	@uncannyr @MOOFIEcowstine @Overbro_ anti-meme and being so triggered over the idea that people can separate fiction to reality and not be weirded by fiction coz' it's just fiction and nothing is really there. Bring that argument elsewhere first, do you think video games are equal to actual genocide then?
Gaming	Im sorry @PlayStation I just want my account back
Gaming	@mortivoree @Xbox That's why it's my banner...

Gaming	@sorenT77 Replace alcohol and smoking with video games and food and then I agree XD
Gaming	I'm glad I never cared but Disney movies (or just movies in general) I don't know. I literally just don't have any attachments to movies. I just prefer video games because I vastly prefer interactive media and just get bored watching movies.
Gaming	Tomorrow, back to bring nice and feeling empathy and worrying about if I'm messing up in video games. That other stuff was eating away at me and haunted me. I feel so much better. I should be really better mentally very soon. Made good changes, made a goal, next get new glasses!
Gaming	@yzomiu eat a late lunch on friday to avoid dinner, wake up late on saturday, play video games/do homework/workout throughout the day, avoid dinner as long as possible. it helps that my family is busy and out of the house on the weekends so :P
Gaming	16. My favorite video games have to be Animal Crossing, Smash bros, Kirby and Roblos :)
Gaming	@RockstarSupport the least you guys can do it fix the crash bug in ps4 and Xbox with the heavy sniper
Gaming	Just finished No More Heroes 3. What a fantastic video game! Loved the boss fights and the writing a lot! A game that knows what it is and doesn't really stray from that. Really hoping for more games that feel like this from Grasshopper in the future.
Gaming	@poncho_playa @kidsmoove I would acknowledge that it would be big, just not Xbox nail in the coffin big. If Sony did buy them and then sought to make all their stuff exclusive, then Microsoft can drop a massive COD exclusive bomb on Sony's head once existing agreements are done.
Gaming	@PlayStation Hogwarts fans, get excited!
Gaming	@JeremyCom Cuphead isn't hard, you just suck at video games.

Gaming	@AlexSourGraps I was playing video games and had it as background noise. Soooo yeah. Wouldnt say wasted time.
Gaming	@Acesandy1 @gorillaarmy88 @Yan2295 Yup. I saw a guy with 680 gamerscore on xbox and rank 1500, he obviously did the RP glitch. And well. He was fine.

Gaming	@XaeSZN Xbox sadly
Gaming	@Picklemaddierix i will! eventually! also you should come over to talk video games and play switch with me and Hex
Gaming	@SelectWomanTaft Ah cool! And I thought they were going for a better colour for the video games as Silver didn't look good on the original ones
Gaming	@Ace2starz107 Yooooooo I miss sesame street. Makes me think of Simpler times. Like should I go with cocoa pebbles or fruit loops while I watch. Maybe play some video games and just chill alllllllll day
Gaming	@Tracker_RY Xbox Series X is still available on Walmart as of right now!
Gaming	@jtwilson37 @GameGeniPrime Not cheaply made per say but they've always been too small for my hands. The xbox controllers are the perfect size for me.
Gaming	Why would you disrespect your son by letting a nigga youre fucking, play on his PlayStation and eat his fruit snacks?
Gaming	Random thought tonight: A couple years ago I never imagined that I would stream video games as a hobby. Now it is something I really enjoy doing. I appreciate all the support and will continue to work to improve my content. #ESOFam #twitchstreamer

Gaming	@DmMoax This was one of the first video games I ever played.
Gaming	@ForHonorGame So with the addition of cross play. When phase two hits. Will I have the ability to merge my xbox and playstation accounts? I have progress on both and I'd like to be able have both reps on both platforms.
Gaming	@jbonapa1 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Lol not everyone is a blind fanboy like you bud. I love my PlayStation. I can admit when a game doesnt look the best. I can call out clowns like you that cant even type a sentence correctly. Its not hard.
Gaming	@irodeyourmom2 @GRIMMYRAX @GameGeniPrime people bitching about the thumbsticks between playstation and xbox when them shits are all the same lol
Gaming	@roryoftheabyss @ResumeSleeq @smtV_XB2 @PlayStation Ok, so you know. Now why do you care what one person thinks?
Gaming	@IGN if its not cross platform because apart from one of my friends everyone has an xbox one and if Id pick this up Id be playing on my own. Rockstar is ridiculous
Gaming	@JayZee_XO @jdogggful @blakeway_luke @EBGamesAus Can you play PS1, PS2 and PS3 games on the PS5? No you cant! But on the Xbox Series X you can play original Xbox games, Xbox 360 games and Xbox One games. Microsoft has nailed the backwards compatibility.

Gaming	Playing video games with the boys gonna be too 5 best things
Gaming	Anyone on PlayStation?
Gaming	@Colteastwood I got the ps5 since I have a pc, I enjoy having both but Xbox is got the best studios these days hands down.
Gaming	@marlisjun Well since all this debacle about the systems I'm thinking definitely grabbing a PS5 ( if it's available to buy that is) and play these games . Saw the state of play looks amazing.. I've been an Xbox player mostly but Horizon etc really want to play it. Getting my son one too
Gaming	Rock is playing video games right now with the faint sound of water running from his turtle aquarium in the background
Gaming	@Lombrad00673265 @zmac9906 @Rainbow6Game Xbox siege is a joke. My friends get sound glitches then kicked, then they rejoin only to get it again not one round later.

Gaming	@Sylencioo @Stormlinski76 Only thing is you can't play on Xbox one anymore after the transfer but it's worth it

Gaming	@C_Rumbel @firas_killer @majornelson Its only $10 us instead of the $20 Xbox. So slight discount and end up saving $30 total.
Gaming	@kidsmoove Bro this is the fucking reason why xbox is buying up many studios so that they can implement these features in their games. I think Microsoft is pissed on third party developers for not optimising and utilising rdna 2 feature in games.
Gaming	@AJEnglish the volunteer if they escape death in ukraine they will be mentally sick and with psychiatric problems once the war finish. the war isnt like in playstation
Gaming	@ChalsAbuah @dleonxl @MSTretrogaming @VGC_News Brother, this includes deathloop and psychnauts, both PlayStation and Xbox multiplats, that Xbox game studios had no part in.

Gaming	@PlayStation It's gonna be available on all platform
Gaming	@SkullziTV Oh man! This generation's console wars version is ridiculous. I see many PS (me PS only) accounts bashing Starfield for no reason. Xbox doesn't interest me but I assure you I will get one for Starfield. BGS is my N.1 games. I haven't waited all this time for nothing

Gaming	@MySlimee Xbox
Gaming	@dleonxl @Is_a_dumb_name @1andDon3 @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation Of course they can always defend themselves rather easily, or just ignore it. But it will cause them bad press. Even worse if it's a first party game.
Gaming	im gonna play video games until i fall asleep. gn.
Gaming	@Hey1mJay The PvZ Heroes origin story that is depicted in the video linked here, is the opening animated comic book cinematic in the video game. Its much shorter because people want to get into gameplay as soon as possible on mobile games.
Gaming	Uncharted review: Sad PlayStation approved a continuity error plot lacking enough puzzles and forgot Nate's Personality and jokes. The journey felt too easy, rushed, and the casting for Sully and Nate was poorly done. I love Mark and Tom, but no. Lackluster writing.
Gaming	@harv056 @emeriticus @barnes_law There is if youre chasing down goat herders in Afghanistan with full air superiority, and a bombing campaign that flattens wherever your headed beforehand, and then you get airlifted back into an air conditioned barracks where you go lift weights and play video games
Gaming	@1andDon3 @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation What an idiot. The reality is that this cheap tactics and timed exclusive games is what Sony can afford
Gaming	@MLGchimpfeet Yeah exactly. In game challenges were just easier and were more accessible for causal players. Yeah Achievements died with Xbox One in my opinion due to the interface and profile display. Was still fun getting them though

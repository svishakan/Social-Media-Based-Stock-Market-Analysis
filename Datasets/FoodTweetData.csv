Food	2020-05-06	3	I will be happy if $BYND ever drops below $90 again so I can buy more! The train might be leaving the station after a 6 month trading range. A Mcdonald's $MCD announcement will take it to $140.
Food	2020-05-06	1	I remember when @davidein and bears bet massively against $GMCR, with a double down at 15. Then ceo came out and said SBUX partnership extended for next 5 years. Game completely changed. Shorts got roasted. $BYND same thing here poss. With $MCD news.
Food	2020-05-06	1	$BYND going right to 115-1177. To test Bear thesis, who believed $MCD partnership was over since mum post-trial. Far from it, says Ethan. NO ISSUE with that relationship.
Food	2020-05-06	1	$WEN BUY. proof that you must invest in co's with a management team that you believe in. co is outperforming in the harshest of environments and momentum is real. more upside to come. $MCD $QSR $SBUX $SHAK
Food	2020-05-06	1	@jessicawohl @jonathanmaze Is $WEN apparent success at breakfast why $MCD breakfast is doing so poorly?
Food	2020-05-06	1	"$WEN ludicrously up 7% on ""earnings"" --- another fast food where they are telling stories while business is lousy $CMG $DNKN $MCD etc"

Food	2020-05-06	1	$SPY $WEN $MCD $BRK.B Once again, the Fed printing money will not stop meat shortages & ; supply chain disruptions
Food	2020-05-06	1	$WEN breakfast a success (and for good reason...product is legit)...will lead to upgrades from analysts. another catalyst to come, INTL expansion (obviously after covid-19); stock should start moving to all time highs. $MCD $QSR $SBUX $SHAK
Food	2020-05-06	2	$WEN proved this quarter that their breakfast is legit! we will be ordering breakfast from @Wendys this am! $MCD $QSR $SBUX
Food	2020-05-06	1	$WEN 'breakfast exceed our initial expectations'; $385mln in cash; id'd $30mln of savings in capex/admin expenses. strong growth in digital biz; suspend buyback/reduce div (expected). Strong management paying off for investors. $MCD $QSR $SHAK $SBUX
Food	2020-05-06	2	Meat shortages are likely to be temporary and are being unevenly experienced. $MCD has not yet felt any shortages, the Times reported, but $SHAK executives have warned of beef price increases.
Food	2020-05-06	1	$MCD longs must be getting a little uncomfortable. The daily chart is worrisome.
Food	2020-05-06	2	@JWilliamsFstmed @APompliano @polina_marinova @Wendys @McDonalds $MCD has around a 6 month supply of burgers hanging out in the freezer
Food	2020-05-06	1	Bottom line, you can try to walk back comments. But the excitement about the relationship in the original comment was real. And THAT is all that matters. $BYND and $MCD about to announce next steps in their relationship together very soon. And it is VERY GOOD.
Food	2020-05-06	1	"Interestingly, after a few other questions $BYND ceo circled back to address $MCD trial end again. To attempt to walk back ""I assure you there is no issue with MCD"" comment, which all but confirmed MCD relationship continues/ expands. Said don't look too much into it. #crookedaf"

Food	2020-05-07	1	@PresciencePoint $MIDD historically did VERY LITTLE with $MCD and only recently has increased its business via the Taylor acquisition. It goes back to a dispute over fryers and intellectual property. $MCD is mainly a $WBT account, but hey, why let facts get in the way of a lazy short thesis?
Food	2020-05-07	1	@PresciencePoint $MCD's 41% capex cut is mainly fewer store of the future formats, which involve digital menu boards and kiosks. $MIDD does not participate in any of that, and in general has very low exposure new U.S. restaurant construction.

Food	2020-06-12	1	@TMFStoffel Personally, no. But it may not be as overpriced as it appears for aforementioned reasons. I wouldn't have bought $MCD in the last 10 years for a lot of the same reasons you listed about $SBUX. Yet somehow it tripled.
Food	2020-06-12	1	@patrickfacey_ Agreed. But would you buy $MCD at 150 (or even 30) times EPS?

Food	2020-06-12	9	@franzvonloewe @ptynole @BrianSozzi Its also a way to increase profitability, Id rather give away a McDouble for $1 on the app (where you can only buy 1) instead of letting you buy 5 at one time. Also, we watch the $mcd average check via app purchases for more insights.
Food	2020-06-12	9	@BrianSozzi $MCD is finally starting to push the app (mobile order & ; pay) via advertising. Many markets have switched their deep discounting into app offers. For example, instead of doing $1 McDouble in-store they will put in on the app.

Food	2020-07-28	1	As the wing king, it pains me to see such ridiculous expectations baked into $WING. It's a f*cking wing delivery joint. $MCD results, particularly US sales down over 2% in June yoy, are a negative read-across to $WING. And if stimulus/unemployment checks cease? Watch out below.

Food	2020-07-28	5	$MCD relative valuation blows my mind. Even disregarding the awful 2020, theyre at normalised 25x 21E P/E and 17x 21E EBITDA. SSS fell 24% last Q due to COVID19. Meanwhile, $INTC grew revenues 20% last quarter, yet trades at 10.9x PE and 6.8x 21E EBITDA. Both mega-caps.

Food	2020-09-05	10	The reason Im even researching this is for #StockMarket reasons. This will be a good call to get in on for 2 reasons: 1) $MCD quarterly is a little over a month away. 2) Travis Scott name has a proven success to drive a market value.
Food	2020-09-05	10	3. When a stock pays a heavy dividend, has a great brand, and even better financials, it tends to have a higher P/E. This is because dividends pay back the money you invested faster. One example is McDonald's $MCD with a P/E of 34.

Food	2020-11-07	1	@HonoluluBlue90 So $MCD was able to grow sales at 7%, pay a dividend, and buy back shares. (Grated some of this was net added debt) but it shows massive reinvested is not needed. High ROIC will always crush the S & ;P and $MCD will continue to do so on an operational level comparison.
Food	2020-11-07	1	"@HonoluluBlue90 Just because a company doesn't have increasing top line numbers doesn't mean a company isn't growing Comp sales for $MCD is up while total revenue is down ""Systemwide sales increased 4% (7% in constant currencies) to $100.2 billion. Currencies and restructuring matter."
Food	2020-11-07	1	@HonoluluBlue90 Semantics. EPS growth is still growth no matter where it comes from. More cash is still showing up for the owners. Buy backs are no different that acquisitions. If $MCD shuts off buybacks and buys Wendys now you say they are growing again?
Food	2020-11-07	1	@ssstock $MCD doesn't really grow. They pay out all thier earnings via dividends & ; Buybacks. You get some growth per share via the buybacks but in general they don't reinvest and can't see them outperforming the index going forward.
Food	2020-11-07	1	You now get to spend ALL of your dividends and still create wealth FASTER than the average retirement account or index fund owner. Even if you reinvested all your dividends from the index $MCD still beats you!
Food	2020-11-07	1	For instance, the average ROIC for an S & ;P index fund is 8%. $MCD has average ROIC of 22%. This means McDonald's can give you 60% of their cash flow and they will still grow faster than a S & ;P index fund! This is powerful. This is life changing. This is wealth building.

Food	2020-11-09	2	On $BYND conference call, lots of questions about $MCD announcement today anout new McPlant product, which MCD made clear was designed in MCD labs. BYND telling folks they co-created McPlant. Key issue likely that BYND wants at least sub-brand status, which MCD wont agree to.
Food	2020-11-09	2	Imagine buying $bynd on the news that they help $mcd to create their own product Karma is a b***
Food	2020-11-09	1	@Kenwicks When a product is doing great it doesn't get cut by $MCD...it also doesn't grow < ;3% YOY in the most favorable environment in history. $BYND
Food	2020-11-09	1	@BrianMirenda $MCD is a high float stock bro, meaning they have 100 million + shares which is a crazy amount of supply. They wont move much at all even with the biggest news boost. Reason why I choose stocks with lower floats. Still I didnt see MCD being a clapperino but it just tanked.
Food	2020-11-09	1	Time to buy the $40 dip!! $BYND $MCD
Food	2020-11-09	1	@dividendsNdrip First the McDonalds announcement now this miss! Double whammy! $BYND $MCD

Food	2020-11-10	1	Q: You described $MCD more benignly MCD basically said they were going on their own it sounds like you didnt like that and you were collaborating with them. I think you are spooking people - you are not telling investors anything substantial, so we have to assume the worst.
Food	2020-11-10	1	Q: are you okay with not having $BYND branding show up on the menu? A: I would say I'm not given the momentum we have with consumers, we think it deserves to be up there - nearly all of our QSRs have done that and have benefitted from it. We cant speak for $MCD though.

Food	2021-01-23	1	$JBLU, $ATI, $MUR , $X, $WDC, $MCD, $DECK, $SHW, $BAH, $LLY, $CHD, $CAT, $WY, $CVX, are some of the additional companies reporting earnings this week along with numerous banks and financial institutions.
Food	2021-01-23	1	As for logistics: current workers at $MCD, for example, would see no change in their paychecks, but they would have an app that tracks their biweekly purchases of $MCD stock. They would also have the option of using the app as their main investing brokerage account.
Food	2021-01-23	1	A minimum wage hike is digestible by megacorps like $MCD that can handle it, while pressuring small businesses that already have many disadvantages, including shutdowns. This policy removes the negative of small businesses having to raise labor costs on already thin profits.
Food	2021-01-23	5	"Instead of raising the minimum wage to $15/hour in all states, I have a better solution to help the ""wealth gap"" that also helps small business: every hourly worker at a public company like $MCD gets a 15% raise payable in company stock that must be held for at least one year."

Food	2021-01-24	2	@oakazaki @BioRunner59 @laurenboebert I love people who say $15 min wage will make $MCD or Taco Bell cost same as sit down meal. Your $6 value meal has $1.50 of labor in it now. Pay people 2x and it will cost $7.50, not $17.50.
Food	2021-01-24	2	@oakazaki @BioRunner59 @laurenboebert Also $MCD is franchised. They dont pay the $15. But franchisees in many countries pay $15 or more and still make money. Places where the Min Wage is 2x, the burgers cost about 25% more than in the US. Labor is 20-30% of restie costs so they make same.

Food	2021-04-22	16	"I remember $SBUX sent employees down the line to get orders to increase commitment that they don't leave. At the local $MCD at lunch it's full capacity.

Food	2021-05-21	16	@supercimomo @daniel_toloko True. One problem I have with $MCD is that even if they couldn't reinvest back into more restaurants, they could have bought back over 10% of the shares outstanding in just 4 years!
Food	2021-05-21	8	To think $MCD could have increased EPS by a whopping $0.34/share (which is a 16% increase from the latest reported EPS of $2.04) is staggering. $MCD could have also bought back over 10% of their outstanding shares at today's price.
Food	2021-05-21	8	How I came up with these numbers: 1. Each building costs as high as $2.03ml, so I used that. $13,677bl/$2.03ml = 6715 restaurants. 2. $MCD generates roughly $150k per franchise including the 4% cut and rent. 6715x$150k = $1bl in revenue. 3. Used $MCD historical 24% net margin.

Food	2021-05-21	8	#Research #investing @daniel_toloko Since 2017, $MCD has paid out $13,677bl in dividend payments. What else could they have done with that money? 1) Open 6,715 more franchises. 2) Add $1bl more in revenue. 3) Add $241ml in net income. 4) Increase EPS $0.34/share.
Food	2021-05-21	8	@RealHerbHoover @daniel_toloko A franchise costs $45ml. I believe I got confused so the numbers might be off a little as @daniel_toloko pointed out. The point remains. $MCD could have bought back over 10% of its shares with that money, or created shareholder value a different way.

Food	2021-09-12	10	@snird Here and there it does happen. I own a large moat of 107 companies, many Div Aristocrats. Ones like $JNJ, $PG, $PEP, $MSFT, and $TGT have a good shot at being around 50 years from now. I do my best to own companies that have a payout ratio of 40% or so w/ low debt to keep safe

Food	2021-10-29	1	10) Ultimately the way this battle b/t $MCD and $DASH plays out will provide more clarity on the strength of DoorDash's aggregator status.
Food	2021-10-29	1	9) I tend to agree with this opinion & ; believe $DASH probably needs $MCD more than the other way around. Which is why I dont think $DASH is a good business b/c its a weak aggregator.

Food	2021-11-30	7	@Post_Market @PreparedRemarks @buccocapital $MCD franchisees had gripes about all the additional machines for McFlurries, Lattes etc. $MCD takes a % of Rev and franchisees eat off FCF. Those are conflicting objectives. Maxing out dollars in a box by adding items also creates complexity which delays order output.

Food	2021-12-11	1	@value_invest12 @memyselfandi006 $MCD has 50% EBITDA margins...beyond that I dont understand the value of comparing them this is beyond silly
Food	2021-12-11	1	@value_invest12 @comlb15 This makes no sense. Besides current cash flow, or lack thereof, $McD is ~40% EBIT so even if $TDOC got to 30% it should have a lower sales multiple (why they're meaningless). And it needs 6 years at 60% growth to catch on GP, still not touching EBIT $. More to fall.
Food	2021-12-11	1	@value_invest12 comparing $MCD to $TDC is by far the silliest thing I have seen on here...you know sales multiple is irrelevant for $MCD as 1) it has 50% EBITDA margins so you are willingly ignoring that 2) is a FRANCHISE model, lol system wide sales are north of $100Bn

Food	2022-01-04	1	There are much better companies out there for dividends and even growth than $MCD eventhough they have a massive moat in the restaurants and bar space What are your thoughts on this & ; McDonalds? Would love to hear some opinions.
Food	2022-01-04	1	I am personally not an investor in $MCD I talk about this in the Playbook Never mind the fact that it has a relatively small dividend yield at 2% or $5.5 a year per share I would use this company more so for capital preservation than appreciationalthough it has grown +25% YTD
Food	2022-01-04	1	Assuming earnings per share of $2.28 with some quick math at current share price $MCD PE ratio would be around 117 This means investors are willing to pay $117 dollars more for every 1$ of profit the company makes No wonder return on investment is in the negatives here.
Food	2022-01-04	1	Due to the fact that $MCD essentially is killing it relative to the space it operates in, investors are willing to spend MORE/share which is shown in its PE ratio & ; ROE (return on investment) $MCD ROE is -37.4% ouch if you want more return youre better off investing elsewhere
Food	2022-01-04	1	$MCD total revenue is approx $6.20B with the median in the sector being just over $184M so still a king in the game $MCD net income is huge too at $2.1B with the sector trailing at 11.2M I can see how McDonalds dominates Its clear that its more than just a fast food chain.

Food	2022-02-01	8	3/10 When $CMG went public, its menu was focused on only four options: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. All of $CMG's food is prepared with just 53 ingredients, greatly simplifying its food supply chain. In contrast, $MCD's is said to be using as many as 650 items.
Food	2022-02-01	8	2/10 $MCD used franchising as its primary mode of growth; in 2020, 93% of all its outlets were franchised. But $CMG founder Steve Ells believed that you should only franchise your store operations if you need people and money. Chipotle, in his view, already had both.
Food	2022-02-01	8	1/10 To be fair, $MCD's had a huge hand in helping Chipotle become what it is today. The burger chain invested US$340 million in $CMG over nine years between 1998 and 2006. But when it comes to how restaurants should operate, the partners were worlds apart.

Food	2022-03-18	10	@DividendDandy I have $PEP, its a great dividend stock
Food	2022-03-18	50	Since 2008, a portfolio of Coca-Cola $KO, Pepsi $PEP, and Dr. Pepper $DPS would have returned 9.9% annually without a single down year (counting dividends). This reliability is why beverage stocks are the inevitable backbone for retirees, buy-and-holders, and income investors.

Food	2022-03-25	9	@JoinCommonstock $BYND I believe food shortage may be a real potential issue and will need to seek alternatives to mitigate this problem. Food shortage can impact many companies such as $MCD, $CMG, etc.
Food	2022-03-25	9	@BillAckman $MCD publicly rejected Ackman's proposal. But quietly caved in by beginning a process of selling its restaurants to franchisees. The stock eventually doubled over two years, a big move for a large cap!
Food	2022-03-25	9	@BillAckman $MCD felt that their restaurant business was profitable. Because they were making high- to mid-teens margins. This would indeed be considered profitable for a restaurant... Except they were mistaken! They weren't charging themselves rent or a franchise fee.
Food	2022-03-25	9	@BillAckman But $MCD was doing the exact opposite. They were buying out their franchisees and turning them into company operated stores. Even when the economics of running a restaurant is not nearly as attractive as the business of collecting a royalty in exchange for a brand.
Food	2022-03-25	9	@BillAckman Ackman took a position in $MCD in late 2005. His goal was to convince management to sell or spin off its company-operated stores to its top franchisees. Its franchisees were better at running the stores and would improve the operating performance of the restaurants.

Food	2022-04-26	1	@JohnAGordon @jonathanmaze @McNuday Historically, $MCD doesnt typically buy restaurants unless they are doing a FROF. Zees are willing to pay much more than McOpCo is willing to pay for restaurants. McD has the money, but typically wont spend it.
Food	2022-04-26	1	@jonathanmaze @McNuday @McD_Truth IMO 5% is too low even for $MCD if you look at the record. Growing off of a 5% base can happen incrementally over time given zee retirements.

Food	2022-04-26	1	@jonathanmaze If you dont own any restaurants, you have no farm club for Corp. No pipeline of internal restaurant talent. You need restaurant ppl to help run a restaurant company. Thats my concern for $McD, going from 20% to 5% Corp restros. Less of a talent pool for future leadership.

Food	2022-05-13	9	@twitandrewking I cannot believe this is a thing. Does $MCD actually have telemetry in their that provide queryable health info to do this or is there an army of Ottawa citizens doing gods work to spread the word on this vital public service availability?
Food	2022-05-13	9	$BYND I was hesitant when I placed an order to buy a call option on this trading day. Considering the company's current debt ratio, a likely scenario would be privatization or acquisition. It's possible, $MCD $PEP even Impossible Foods may buy it (no, I don't want that happen).

Food	2022-05-13	10	@LEADER_TRADING I don't love this thesis but it's not the worst. Analogy is Berkshire grabbing $KO...it's a great hedge against short term volatility but you could still make money in $pep or even $soda depending on your style. It all depends on how YOU, the trader, make moves (or don't).

1448	Gaming	@kidsmoove Bro this is the fucking reason why xbox is buying up many studios so that they can implement these features in their games. I think Microsoft is pissed on third party developers for not optimising and utilising rdna 2 feature in games.	-2

1462	Gaming	Uncharted review: Sad PlayStation approved a continuity error plot lacking enough puzzles and forgot Nate's Personality and jokes. The journey felt too easy, rushed, and the casting for Sully and Nate was poorly done. I love Mark and Tom, but no. Lackluster writing.	-1

1484	Gaming	@Mentos49079252 Yeah that and the fact that outside of comics Superman doesnt get pushed as much in things like Cartoons and video games. So people just take injustice and run with it.	-2
1485	Gaming	@kidsmoove I think Xbox games will be very much optimised and make the 3rd party games look sus, which may force them to utilise every feature. And 3rd party developers already know that the players will only buy their games if they are very good else they know people have game pass.	0
1486	Gaming	@fforigin @FinalFantasy @PlayStation @Xbox @fforigin PS4 players cannot transfer demo saves because the wrong version was uploaded for the early access. Demo is Version 1.01; Full game is 1.00... will there be a fix for this soon?	-2

1593	Gaming	@ChaiThePie I love you too Keana so fucking much youve been here with me for 13 years like holy fuck weve just naturally been playing video games for that long together we just get on and play no setup no play date	2
1594	Gaming	11. This is sorta twofold Video games have always been an escape for me, plus I've always been surrounded by music. It's part of how I connect to things, people, places, etc. So those two things together make for a very meaningful experience	2
1595	Gaming	@8Osjk Seokjin definitely, is my bias because he resembles my type of man, that sense of humor, playing video games, cooking and fishing, activities exciting enough for me	1

1597	Gaming	@dleonxl @Is_a_dumb_name @1andDon3 @MrboomstickXL @Xbox @PlayStation Tbf, advertising another companies work can lead to negative press for your company. Say you owned Sony and advertised Cyberpunk 2077 heavily, doing most of the marketing,etc. Well if the game is bad, Sony is going to be questioned on why they advertised the game.	-2
1598	Gaming	@RebelTheArtGal @MOOFIEcowstine @Overbro_ no lol are you retarded i said jerking off to a drawing of a child is weird given that fiction or not you only jerk off to shit that you find hot, idk why you think the same logic somehow applies to killing people in video games	-2
1599	Gaming	@GoScv120 In my opinion, I totally agree. Actually, companies have more costs to improve the quality of their products, as a result of which video games are no exception.	0

1601	Gaming	@Volataride @ZubyMusic Because this person is allowed to tell others what is fun and what is not? I don't find video games fun anymore, but does that mean they're not? No. They're just not mu cup of tea.	-2

1603	Gaming	Does anyone know of any articles exploring any relationship between newer video games that center/build off of storytelling based off of Norse mythology and increased or changing formations of global white ethno-nationalism (also read as continued Lost Cause)?	-2
1604	Gaming	@uncannyr @MOOFIEcowstine @Overbro_ anti-meme and being so triggered over the idea that people can separate fiction to reality and not be weirded by fiction coz' it's just fiction and nothing is really there.

1616	Gaming	@poncho_playa @kidsmoove I would acknowledge that it would be big, just not Xbox nail in the coffin big. If Sony did buy them and then sought to make all their stuff exclusive, then Microsoft can drop a massive COD exclusive bomb on Sony's head once existing agreements are done.	-1
